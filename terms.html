                        <h2 class="mt-4">1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                        <p><strong>1.1.</strong> These Terms and Conditions ("Terms," "Agreement") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("the Player," "you") and the operator of Ritzo Casino ("the Company," "we," "us").</p>
                        <p><strong>1.2.</strong> This Agreement governs your use of all our online gaming services, including our website, mobile applications, and any related products (collectively, the "Services").</p>
                        <p><strong>1.3.</strong> By ticking the box for acceptance during the registration process, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted these Terms, along with our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, and Responsible Gambling Policy, which are integral parts of this Agreement.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-4">2. Your Player Account</h2>
                        <p><strong>2.1. Registration and Eligibility:</strong> To use our Services, you must register for a personal account ("Account"). To be eligible, you must be at least 19 years of age (or the legal age for gambling in your jurisdiction, whichever is higher). You must provide accurate and complete information during registration and keep this information up to date.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.2. Account Security:</strong> You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your ritzo casino login credentials. This includes taking all necessary measures to protect your Ritzo casino login password. You are fully responsible for all activity that occurs on your Account. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security. We are not liable for any loss you may incur as a result of someone else using your account, with or without your knowledge.</p>
                        <p><strong>2.3. Account Verification (KYC):</strong> We are required by law to verify the identity, age, and address of our players.

                        <p><strong>3.2. Withdrawals:</strong> You may request a withdrawal from your real money balance, provided that your account is fully verified and you have met any applicable bonus wagering requirements. We reserve the right to process withdrawals to the same method used for depositing, where possible. Processing times may vary depending on the method and any additional verification checks required.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt-4">4. Bonuses and Promotions</h2>

                        <p><strong>4.2. Wagering Requirements:</strong> Most bonuses come with wagering requirements that must be fulfilled before the bonus funds or associated winnings can be withdrawn. The specific requirements will be clearly stated in the promotional terms.</p>
                        <p><strong>4.3. Bonus Abuse:</strong> We have a strict policy against bonus abuse. Any player found to be abusing promotional offers may have their bonuses and winnings voided and their account closed.</p>
