              <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from mrbetcanada.net (the "Website").

              <p>When you visit the Website, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Website, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Website, and information about how you interact with the Website. We refer to this automatically-collected information as "Device Information."</p>
              <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. (Please refer to our Cookie Policy for more details).</li>

We refer to this information as "Order Information."</p>
